# Training files

This GitHub repository contains all the files we'll use for our trainings, organized by date. When you first download this repo to your machine, you'll need to run this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/UBCO-iGEM/trainings.git
```

Then, you can open the necessary folder in VS code and get going. Before future trainings start, be sure to run `git pull` to get the up-to-date version of this repo.
